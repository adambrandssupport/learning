"Hey ChatGPT, my name is Janny. I originally hail from Uttar Pradesh, but I've been residing in Surat, Gujarat, for the past 23 years with my family of four. My dad works in a diamond company, my mom is a homemaker, and I have an elder brother who is a CA. I completed my schooling and undergraduate education in the same city. I pursued my BCA from VNSGU, which is the top university in Surat.

During my BCA, I was proactive and completed a full-stack development course within 2-3 weeks. In this course, I gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and I also learned about deployment using tools like Netlify, Vercel, and Firebase. After finishing the course, I received job offers from two companies. I decided to join PrepBytes because I was already familiar with some of the people there, and I liked the work culture.

I worked at PrepBytes for 1.5 years and am currently employed at Hashtag Company as a Senior Full Stack Developer. In my current role, I oversee junior developers, testers, and designers."
